# You may at this point have noticed loads of hash signs - # - and are wondering why?
# Well, the hash sign # is used  as a starter sign for a line where you'll place a comment to your code.
# What ever comes after the # is not read as a code, but merely as what it is:
# A note, message or explanation to the code.

print ("Be carefull not to write too long lines. Try to keep the length of your lines below 80 carracters.")
# This is a comment. Text in comments have a different color as do statements like print.
print ("Comments can be added at the end of a line to explain the code.")
print ()
print ('kelvin = celcius * 273.14    # Inserts the degrees in celcius.')
print ()
print ("You can also print multiple lines with only one print statement.")
print ('To do this you must enclose the text with 3 """double quotes at the beginning and 3 """double quotes at the end of the text.')
print ("""This text is printed on several lines.
Here we used 3 double quotes in the beginning and end of
the text. Note that the line shift comes automaticly.""")
print ('''Naturally you can also use the single quotes
to print long text to the console window.
And single quotes obey the same rules as double quotes.
By using single quotes you can include the double quotes in the text.
"He said hello to the world."''')
print ()
print ("""Often you have to make longer comments to your code.
To avoid filling your code with the hash sign you simply enclose
the comment with 3 '''single quotes at the beginning and end of the comment.'''
This allows you to write multiple lines of comments to you code""")
print ()
'''
Here I've made my own comment to my code. I preferr to start the line comment with the 3
single quotes and then make a line shift like I've done here. I also place the last 3 single quotes 
on a separate line. This makes it much easier to spot longer comments.
Remember, that you can't make enough comments to your code. In the long term it ease
up the understanding of your code, especially when you after a while returns
to review the code.'''

"""Naturally you can use # " at the beginning and 3 " at the end of 
longer comments.
